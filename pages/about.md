# About

This is a [starter template](https://vsoch.github.io/docsy-jekyll/) for a Docsy Jekyll *About Page*. 
Docsy Jekyll is intended for deployment on GitHub pages. 

See the [respository]({{ site.repo }}) for more details.

Docsy Jekyll is based on the beautiful [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) that renders with Hugo. 
Hugo is not native to Github pages.
