- This post is in the `_posts` directory. 
- You may edit this and other pages then re-build the site to see your changes.
- To rebuild this site you may run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

- To add new posts, simply add a file to the `_posts` directory.
- The file should have:
1. `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` The date of post in the filename
2. The post must include the necessary YAML front matter. 

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
