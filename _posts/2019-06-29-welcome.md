- This doc is in the `_posts` directory. 
- You may edit this and other pages then re-build the site to see your changes.
- To rebuild this site run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and regenerates your site when a file is updated.

- For new posts, add a file to the `_posts` directory and the following criteria:
1. `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` The date of post in the filename
2. The post must include the necessary YAML front matter, see above
3. Badges can be added as needed

Additionally, Jekyll also offers support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
